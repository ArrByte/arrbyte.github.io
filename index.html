    <p>Here you find everything connected to the games and experimental things.</p>
<p>I love to explore what can be done in using the web to communicate with people
and enabling them to dive into and explore a story - hence I'm making web games.</p>
<p>Here you can find the playable games for the web as well as an archive of older, non-web games I made.
You can also get a glimpse into what I'm doing in the <a href="wip.html">Previews section</a>.</p>
<p>For me, it's very important to be transparent, open and collaborative,
so all my games are licensed under the permissive MIT License.</p>
<p>Feel free to remix, share, change the games listed here or parts of them -
I'd be very happy to hear what you came up with and what you did with them :)
If you'd like to contribute or see the source code, <a href="https://github.com/arrbyte">it's all on Github</a></p>
<p>Never stop exploring.</p>
