Here you find everything connected to the games and experimental things.

I love to explore what can be done in using the web to communicate with people
and enabling them to dive into and explore a story - hence I'm making web games.

Here you can find the playable games for the web as well as an archive of older, non-web games I made.
You can also get a glimpse into what I'm doing in the [Previews section](wip.html).

For me, it's very important to be transparent, open and collaborative,
so all my games are licensed under the permissive MIT License.

Feel free to remix, share, change the games listed here or parts of them -
I'd be very happy to hear what you came up with and what you did with them :)
If you'd like to contribute or see the source code, [it's all on Github](https://github.com/arrbyte)

Never stop exploring.
